 Exercise to practise with binary trees

As a software developer, you are tasked to develop data structures for a health clinic which specializes in physical health, which has a need to sort different food types based on a healthy food index. Since you have recently been working on trees, you decided to create trees for this problem as well to sort the input data. For this, there are several steps you need to take.

Define a suitable comparable Food Product Object that contains the following information: Name, Price and Healthy Eating Index (integer assigned between the range of 0-10, with healthier items closer to 0, best index, and less healthy items closer to 10, worst index). Comparison of Food Product Objects should use the Healthy Eating Index attribute.
